1. 
a) K-NN is does classification and KMeans does clustering.

b)K-NN is supervised since it uses reference labels for the training data
while KMeans doesn't, making it unsupervised.

2.
a)
Rows: The correct labels for the data
Columns: The predicted labels produced.

b)
Precision: Sum of true positives divided by sum of 
true positives plus and of false positives.

Recall: Sum of true positives divided by sum of 
true positives and false negatives.

F1-score: 2*precision*recall/(precision + recall), a weighted 
harmonic mean of the precision and recall

Accuracy: Computes subset accuracy, the set of labels predicted 
for a sample must match the set of corresponding correct labels.

Macro avg: averaging the precision and recall of the system on 
different sets.

Weighted avg: averaging the support-weighted mean per label using 
a weight that depends on the number of true labels of each class

The different rows represents the diffrent classes

c)
Completeness score: If all the data points that are members of a given 
class are elements of the same cluster satisfies completeness, regardless of label.

Homogeneity score: If all of its clusters contain only data points which 
are members of a single class it satisfies homogeneity.

Mutual information Score: A measure of the similarity between two labels of the same data

d)Clustering could be a way to classify, or help classify, data that that 
hasn't been labeled. Once youv'e identified clusters you could 'manually'
classify them correctly as opposed to the random classification in our 
example.
